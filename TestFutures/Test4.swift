        // I have explicitly added the Result type, for readability. e.g., to make it clear that when you call the .andThen method, you get a Result<Int, NoError> parameter passed to the callback.
        
        // It looks like each stage of the .andThen steps cannot introduce a failure. It seems like this is just a cascade of processing the same Result. Which I guess is what the website meant, but I didn't get on first read:
        
        // From website:
        // Using the andThen function on a Future, the order of callbacks can be explicitly defined. The closure passed to andThen is meant to perform side-effects and does not influence the result. andThen returns a new Future with the same result as this future
        
        // I'm not really understanding at this point when the order of callbacks would *not* be explicitly defined.
